	<h1>Practo - Your Medical App</h1>
	<p>In early 2008, Shashank ND was frantically getting together his father’s medical records and scanning them. He wanted to get a second opinion from an American physician, for an operation that his father was about to undertake. If that’s not bad enough, he was also unable to access enough information about the doctor, to make an informed decision before putting his father’s life in the doctor’s hands. This incident urged Shashank and his classmate Abhinav Lal to set up Practo Technologies Pvt. Ltd. The duo founded the company in Bengaluru, in 2008, when they were still college students in their final year of engineering (B.Tech, computer engineering) at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka (read our first coverage of Practo). Though numerous players have come into the practice management space since Practo Ray began, Shashank believes that Practo’s razor sharp focus on product quality and support has enabled it to maintain a steady lead. Practo had earlier raised $4 million in July 2012 and is now on course to raise a series B round of $20 million from existing investors, Sequoia Capital (not confirmed by Practo yet). Just before the updates, we had got in touch with Shashank for an indepth take on Practo’s growth over the years.
